For the past year, we (Grade 10) have been each working hard to each create our own personal project to help better our community. We began by choosing a goal, then built our project and lastly wrote a report detailing our process. Grade 10 has been incredibly stressful for us all but despite this, we all found time to put towards our projects and reports. 

Unfortunately, due to COVID-19, we couldn't invite everyone to our exhibition at school. So that you can still experience our projects we have created this website full of all our projects. You can search for projects, filter projects by global context and watch video demos of our projects.

We're very proud of our projects and hope you enjoy them!
